# PLAYSTORE-DATA-ANALYSIS
#About the project:
In this project, I worked on a real-world dataset of the google play store, one of the most used applications for downloading android apps. This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset, and mining informational quality insights. This project also involves visualizing the data to better and easily understand trends and different categories.

#Project Description: 

This project helped me understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset, pre-process the data using Excel for a better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database, and visualize the data with the bi tool.

#The Project will consist of:
Pre-processing using Excel
Analyzing data using  SQL.
Visualizing data using  Tableau tool.
